\section*{Introduction}
\textbf{Yellowen} (hereafter known as the Provider) is pleased to submit a proposal
for {\PreparedFor} hereafter known as the Client) software development project
for {\ProposalFor} . This proposal describes the technologies,
services, terms, and schedule for the above project.

\section*{About Yellowen}
Since 2010, we've worked with start-ups and companies, building, designing and planning applications,
sites and business concepts on the web and desktop. We have over 8 years in the software development field and a
long list of satisfied customers. We will be happy to provide additional references upon request.

\section*{Services and Technology}
The following section describes the services provided as part of the IT
Consultancy:

Provider use Agile software development method to produce this software
which means provider will analyze the whole software once at phase zero
and hand a technical proposal to client to explain the complete schema of
software and phases which is needed to finish the software. At each phase
provider will use above cycle to complete the goals of the phase and satisfy
the client.

\section*{Deliverables and Testing}
The Provider will deliver the items determined during the Appraisal and
Planning phase of the engagement. The deliverables list will be created and
added as an addendum to this proposal or to the Work Agreement created
at the acceptance of this proposal.


\subsection*{Verification}
\begin{itemize}
\item {"Verification" typically involves reviews and meetings to evaluate
  documents, plans, code, requirements, and specifications.}
\item{This can be done with checklists, issues lists, walkthroughs, and
  inspection meetings.}
\item{Client will have access to a development time prototype, so he can give
    his/her feedbacks to developments team during development cycle.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Validation}
\begin{itemize}
\item{"Validation" typically involves actual testing and takes place after verifications are completed.}
\item{The term “IV and V” refers to Independent Verification and Validation.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Walkthrough}
\begin{itemize}
\item{A “walkthrough” is an informal meeting for evaluation or informational purposes.}
\item{Little or no preparation is usually required.}
\end{itemize}

The result of the inspection meeting should be a written report. Thorough preparation for
inspections is difficult, painstaking work, but is one of the most cost effective methods
of ensuring quality.

The following is a short list of quality assurance principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Test and QA activities start early in the software development life cycle.}
\item{Each step or phase is validated before moving ahead to the next step or phase.}
\item{Repeatable processes are established and used by all like projects.}
\item{Processes are continuously reviewed and improved.}
\end{itemize}


\section*{Technologies of choice}
\subsection*{Language and Framework}
We decided to use RubyOnRails for this project, Ruby is one the best dynamic programming
languages around with very strong meta programming features which is suitable for complex
logics such as one we want to use in this project with reservation and other stuff.

Ruby On Rails is one of the best framework for Ruby language with lots of cool features.
It offer us very fast development and deployment cycle. It uses the MVC development method.
Using ROR cause very neat source tree and source code which is ideal for scalability and
future development.



\section*{Version 1.x Phases Schedule:}

\subsection*{\textbf{Phase Zero:} }
\subsection*{\textbf{Phase One:} }

\section*{Support}

\section*{Terms and Agreement}
The terms for the engagement are defined as follows:

Length:\\
Price:\\
Development method: Agile\\
The Client will be responsible for any expenses incurred during the execution of the
engagement, including travel expenses, per diem, and consumables.

While the Provider may engage other contractors to fulfill specific aspects of the
engagement, the Provider retains responsibility for executing the agreement and will
not assign or transfer any ultimate rights or obligations to third parties.

The provider will invoice the client at the end of each phase of the engagement.



\section*{Conclusion}
Again, we are happy to present this proposal for your review. Upon acceptance of this proposal,
the Provider will draft a comprehensive Statement of Work based of project requirements for your
review that will serve as the project contract between the Provider and the Client.

If you have any questions or need additional information amended to the proposal, please let us
know. You can reach me directly by E-mail at contact@yellowen.com
